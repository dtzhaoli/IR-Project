SCENE I	Venice. A street.</title>

	[Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO]

<speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>	In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
	It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
	What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
	I am to learn;
	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
	That I have much ado to know myself.

	[Exeunt]

	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
